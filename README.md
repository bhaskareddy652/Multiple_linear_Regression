**Toyota Corolla Price Prediction: Multiple Linear Regression **    
-------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains code and analysis for predicting the price of Toyota Corolla cars using multiple linear regression. The dataset includes features such as car age, accumulated kilometers, fuel type, horsepower, and more. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build multiple regression models, and evaluate the model's performance.
--------------------------------------------------------------
**Dataset Description**
The dataset consists of the following variables:

Age: Age of the car (in years)
KM: Accumulated kilometers on the odometer
FuelType: Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)
HP: Horsepower of the car
Automatic: Whether the car is automatic (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
CC: Cylinder volume in cubic centimeters
Doors: Number of doors in the car
Weight: Weight of the car (in kilograms)
Quarterly_Tax: Quarterly tax amount for the car
Price: Offer price of the car (in Euros)
----------------------------------------------------------------
**Steps to Build and Evaluate the Model**
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Building
4. Model Evaluation
5. Regularization (Lasso and Ridge)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
**Tips for Improvement**
You can add more sections to your README file, such as:

Dependencies: List any external libraries you need for running the code (like pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.).
Model Improvements: Discuss ways the model could be improved, such as including more features or using more complex models.
Contribution: Provide instructions for others who want to contribute to the project.
